   abstract = {In order to improve the thrust-weight ratio, modern aeroengines generally adopt a coaxial dual-rotor system. Factors such as manufacturing errors, assembly errors, bearing wear, and structural deformation can cause misalignment failures in a dual-rotor system. Supporting misalignment is one of the common types of misalignments in a dual-rotor system. To analyze the vibration characteristics of misalignment faults, in this study, we aim to build a finite element model of a dual-rotor system with supporting misalignment. The bearing loads caused by supporting misalignment are calculated using the three-bending moment equation method. Bearing loads are introduced into the dynamic model of the dual-rotor system. The influence of supporting misalignment at different bearings on the dynamic characteristics of the rotor system is investigated based on the supporting misalignment model. Studies have shown that supporting misalignment at different bearings has similar effects on the dynamic characteristics of the dual-rotor system. The proposed supporting misalignment model is more adaptable than the coupling misalignment model. It indicates that the damping of a rolling bearing should be considered in the dynamic analysis of a dual-rotor system although the value of the damping is not large. An experimental analysis is carried out. The simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental re-sults.},

   abstract = {Brushless direct current (BLDC) motors are mostly preferred for dynamic applications such as automotive industries, pumping industries, and rolling industries. It is predicted that by 2030, BLDC motors will become mainstream of power transmission in industries replacing traditional induction motors. Though the BLDC motors are gaining interest in industrial and commercial applications, the future of BLDC motors faces indispensable concerns and open research challenges. Considering the case of reliability and durability, the BLDC motor fails to yield improved fault tolerance capability, reduced electromagnetic interference, reduced acoustic noise, reduced flux ripple, and reduced torque ripple. To address these issues, closed-loop vector control is a promising methodology for BLDC motors. In the literature survey of the past five years, limited surveys were conducted on BLDC motor controllers and designing. Moreover, vital problems such as comparison between existing vector control schemes, fault tolerance control improvement, reduction in electromagnetic interference in BLDC motor controller, and other issues are not addressed. This encourages the author in conducting this survey of addressing the critical challenges of BLDC motors. Furthermore, comprehensive study on various advanced controls of BLDC motors such as fault tolerance control, Electromagnetic interference reduction, field orientation control (FOC), direct torque control (DTC), current shaping, input voltage control, intelligent control, drive-inverter topology, and its principle of operation in reducing torque ripples are discussed in detail. This paper also discusses BLDC motor history, types of BLDC motor, BLDC motor structure, Mathematical modeling of BLDC and BLDC motor standards for various applications.},

   abstract = {In this master thesis control of automotive fuel pump has studied. Today, automotive fuel system is an important section of automotive that need improvement because of decreasing air pollution and also better way to decrease energy consumption. And fuel pump is one of important part of fuel system. With a sufficient fuel delivery, it is possible to remove the return fuel line to the fuel tank of automotive. For this purpose a good and sufficient fuel pump is needed.
In the first chapter different fuel pump types are discussed. Then electric motor that is the main part of fuel pump described, after that best motor for fuel pump is selected. The main part of control that described in the thesis is the speed control brushless motor that with respect to it the fuel that pumped is controlled. Also, the other parts of motor control like torque is considered that they are described in detail in the following paragraphs. Fluid dynamic of the pump and which pump is a good option is also discussed and regenerative pump is selected and it used in simulation.
Field oriented control (FOC) is one the best motor control that nowadays, it is also implemented to brushless motors. With FOC the motor the torque ripple is decrease, and current and speed control is also implement in FOC. One of control term that it is used is maximum torque per ampere (MTPA), with MTPA torque control is added to the control and also the quadrature current is created. Then Field oriented control is used for flux control of the motor. With field oriented control, it possible to increase speed when maximum back-emf is reached, it term of operation is like that it decrease the quadrature current that cause flux reduction and it will not
allow the increase of the back-emf.
In mechanical part of pump that it is casing and fuel pump, the regenerative pump is used.
Regenerative pump is one the best pump for high pressure delivery of the fuel to the engine. It mathematical modelling and term of operation is described. And also the fuel characteristic that is one of important part of fuel pressure is also shown.
For simulation of the fuel pump (motor and hydraulic) Matlab, Simulink and Simscape are used.
Then the result of simulation if shown in chapter 5. The simulation result shown the motor operation in reference speed change, battery state of charge change, field weakening. Also, the motor operation effect on fuel pressure and flow rate. And some safety operation that needed in modern electric fuel pump is also discussed.
The torque of the pump that it is according to the speed of the motor and the load of the pump is calculated and it is connected to the motor, that it cause direct effect of torque of electrical motor performance. The pressure simulation for the desired reference values of pressure is done. Also the voltage change effect, motor speed in pressure of the pump. The simulation result are shown in chapter six.},

   abstract = {Brushless DC motors are the most widely used electrical drive in the industry. The development process of the drive is costly and time-consuming. However, various methods can be used to reduce the development time of the drive. This paper presents the Model-Based Design technique of Brushless DC Motor using MATLAB/Simulink with Arduino support block set. The model of BLDC motor is developed using black-box modeling approach; simulations are performed based on real-time data and processed using MATLAB System Identification tool box. The PID Controller is then designed and tuned within the simulations to attain the drive performance. For real-time application, the controller code is generated and uploaded into Arduino Mega embedded controller. The results obtained from simulation and experiment is discussed and compared. The performed works concludes that Model-based design technique can be applied in any control design application using low cost controller such as Arduino embedded controller. Keywords: model based design, brushless dc motor, pid controller, MATLAB/simulink, arduino. INTRODUCTION Model-Based Design (MBD) has been discussed for a decade's but only in recent years it has evolved into a complete design flow from model creation to complete end product. With advanced simulation tools software nowadays, the introduction of graphical control schematic entry tools and control design tools that greatly simplified the task of complex control design and evaluation (Frederiksen 2013). The approach used in model based design is to build the abstract representation (model) of application in a modeling language and then obtain the implementation in a programming language automatically using code generator (Wakankar et al. 2010). Model-Based Design is a process that enables fast and cost-effective development of dynamic systems, including control systems, signal processing, and communications systems. In Model-Based Design, a system model is at the center of the development process, from requirements development through design, implementation, and testing (Matlab 2012).The simulation-based approach offers a better understanding of design alternatives and trade-offs than traditional hardware prototype-based design methodologies, enabling to optimize the design to meet predefined performance criteria. Rather than using complex structures and extensive software code, designers can define models with advanced functional characteristics using continuous time and discrete time building blocks. Existing C code can be integrated with standard control library blocks to maximize design efficiency. The purpose of this paper is to implement control strategies of BLDC motor through Model-Based Design technique. Figure-1 below shows the design flow of Model-Based Design implemented in this paper.
